# silly store game hehe  
terminal-based io game sorta  
patronise or manage a store that sells literally anything but the kitchen sink (provided that the store has it in stock...)

planning to implement fstream or python api or json reading  
on this note, if you decide that you have too much free time, you can try to rewrite the script in python (it's all io so runtime shouldn't matter as much)  
for now, store data in lists/structs initialised in the script
