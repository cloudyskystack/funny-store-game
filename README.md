# silly store game hehe  
terminal-based io game sorta  
patronise or manage a store that sells literally anything (provided they have it in stock...)

currently implementing reading from and writing to csv files  
on this note, if you decide that you have too much free time, you can try to rewrite the script in python (it's all io so runtime shouldn't matter as much)
