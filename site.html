    <h1>unusable website for unusable store</h1>
    hi welcome to my barebone html website for <a href="https://github.com/cloudyskystack/funny-store-game">this public repo project</a>. very amateur very unusable unless you're me<br><br>
    <h2>what's in store</h2>
    see <a href="https://github.com/cloudyskystack/funny-store-game/blob/main/store_inventory.csv">this csv file</a> i dont know how to code in javascript<br><br>
    <h2>$whoami</h2>
    like you or. me or<br>
    unfortunately leaking the database for all user info would be a serious cybersec violation (LMAO as if the entire source code isnt already on the web)
    also telling you anything about me irl is also against the general personal security guideline so yeah no
