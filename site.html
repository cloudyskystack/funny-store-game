    hi welcome to my barebone html website for <a href="https://github.com/cloudyskystack/funny-store-game">this public repo project</a>. very amateur very unusable unless you're me. if on the off chance you actually want to run this thing,<br>
    <ol>
        <li>download all of the files into a folder on your device</li>
        <li>open the folder in vscode or whatever ide you use</li>
        <li>run the file called shop from your terminal</li>
        <li>repeat from step 1 whenever I update. lol</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>what's in store</h2>
    see <a href="https://github.com/cloudyskystack/funny-store-game/blob/main/store_inventory.csv">this csv file</a> i dont know how to use javascript<br><br>
    <h2>$whoami</h2>
    like you or. me or<br>
    unfortunately leaking the database for all user info would be a serious cybersec violation (LMAO as if the entire thing isnt already on the web)
    also telling you anything about me irl is also against every general personal security guideline so yeah no
